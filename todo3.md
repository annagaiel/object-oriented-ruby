Exercise:
Create a new file called manager.rb. Paste in the code from https://github.com/acltc/object-oriented-ruby/blob/498e769ae3d93df6b1562ad8e84bd8a1aeda398c/manager.rb
Create a method in the Manager class called give_all_raises that loops through each of the manager’s employees and gives them a raise (using the give_annual_raise method). Demonstrate how it works.
Create a method in the Manager class called fire_all_employees that loops through each of the manager’s employees and changes their active status to false. (note - you’ll have to modify the Employee class in order to accomplish this!)
