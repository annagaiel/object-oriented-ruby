- Create a new file called inheritance_example.rb and open it in Sublime.
- Copy the Car and Bicycle class into your file: https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/e9b69b4de36b2c41ef4b
- Use inheritance to DRY up the classes. Note - a car is NOT a type of bicycle, and a bicycle is NOT a type of car!
To test it, create a bicycle and car instance from your newly modified classes (you can create them at the bottom of your file). First, have them accelerate. Then, make sure a bike can “Ring ring!” and a car "Beeeeeeep!"
