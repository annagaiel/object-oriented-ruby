-Use the terminal to create a new folder in your acltc folder called object_oriented_ruby.
-Create a new file in the folder called store_item.rb and open it in Sublime.
-Use hashes with symbols to represent the following scenario:
You are the owner of a store that sells items (you decide what specifically). Each item has various properties such as color, price, etc.
-Represent 3 items using hashes. Each hash should have the same keys with different values.
-Be sure to use symbols for the keys. Try creating hashes using both types of hash symbol syntaxes. (Ruby syntax {:a => 123} vs. JavaScript syntax {a: 123}).
-Bonus: Read more about Rubyâ€™s hash symbol syntax:

-Create a hash in irb where both the keys and values are symbols. Which syntax do you prefer?
